# Adblock Plus reveals how it's charging companies to let ads through your ad blocker

Some large companies, including Google, are[rumored to pay the company][0]to show you ads despite the fact that you've installed an ad blocker. Adblock Plus argues that the program is opt-out, however it is sometimes confusing what's really going on.

As part of that initiative,[Adblock Plus has today revealed][1]just what the program involves, how much money it asks for and who it requires to pay for their ads to slip through the filter.

According to the company, only "large entities" need to pay to get on the list while smaller players are able to join the program for free, provided their advertising fits within the criteria.

Larger entities are defined as websites with more than 10 million ad impressions "due to" participation in the program. It asks for a whopping 30 percent of the revenues gained from whitelisting, which likely add up to huge numbers.

The company says that for smaller entities it doesn't require participants to pay, since it's funded by the larger players.
