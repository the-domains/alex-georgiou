description: "I walk up to a large, white mansion. I knock on the door and a woman in a white shirt and black skirt opens the door. She greets me by saying \"hello handsome\" as if we've met before. She grabs the vacuum cleaner I'm holding in my hand and smiles before saying, \"I've been meaning to replace my sucker for some time.\""
