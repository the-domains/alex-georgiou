            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Apple in 2016: Is the mighty iPhone in decline? - BBC News</h1><p>Apple's investors are spooked. Despite a rip-roaring 2015, something peculiar happened this month: Apple's stock value dropped to below $100 for the first time since October 2014. That was down from a high of just over $132 last May.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/adfdee4af1b7ae07182b2c669c564f266890c4ee.jpg"></article>]]></description>

That's because advertisers on these websites have a hard time getting consumers to pay attention to their ads when the pages load so slowly that people abandon them entirely.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f775419d1d4cf71c714a458da35b09785d6bda62.png"></article>]]></description>
