            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sorry Albert!</h1><h2>Creativity is hiding your resources...I think that you might be wrong on this one.</h2><p>No one can deny the importance of discussing and building on each other’s ideas when you’re sailing towards the same goal. Outcomes of a productive and efficient team is very likely to be highly rewarding for all team members especially if out of this procedure comes knowledge, new information and better skills.
